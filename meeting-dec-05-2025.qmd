## Meeting Overview

This document explains the fixes implemented for the Jackknife Figure 2 issues identified on December 2nd. The core problem was that although all counties received a predicted spending value, only ever-treated counties were assigned a value for the binary indicator `high`. Never-treated counties were assigned missing values, which caused them to be dropped from regressions even though they should have remained in the sample.

All analyses now incorporate two fixes:

1. Setting `high = 0` for never-treated units  
2. Removing interactions between `high` and the year effects

## Cross-Specification Comparison

### Summary Table

| Figure | Controls                    | Jackknife |
|:-------|:----------------------------|:---------:|
| 2.1    | Baseline only               |    No     |
| 2.2    | Baseline + Income           |    No     |
| 2.3    | Baseline + Income + Reforms |    No     |
| 2.4    | Baseline only               |    Yes    |
| 2.5    | Baseline + Income           |    Yes    |
| 2.6    | Baseline + Income + Reforms |    Yes    |

### Key Takeaways

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**Patterns Observed**

1. In the non-jackknife regressions, the high group is clearly above the low group.  
2. In the jackknife version, this pattern reverses: the estimated effect for the high group often dips below the low group.
