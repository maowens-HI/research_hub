## Meeting Overview

**Date:** December 5, 2025

**Topic:** Presentation of Figure 2 Results with Both Fixes Applied

This meeting presents the complete set of Figure 2 event study results following the fixes identified on December 2nd. All analyses include both corrections: (1) setting `high=0` for never-treated units, and (2) removing interactions between "high" and year effects.

---

## Context: Fixes Applied

All results presented below incorporate the two critical fixes identified on December 2:

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Fix 1: Missing Data Issue**
- Set `high=0` for never-treated units to include them in interacted regressions

**Fix 2: Interaction Term Issue**
- Removed interactions between "high" and year effects
- Never-treated units now properly influence year effects for all groups

## Results: Six-Step Analysis Sequence

### Phase 1: No Jackknife Specifications

#### Figure 2.1: Baseline Spending Only (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-1}

**Specification:** Core event study with baseline spending quartiles only.

**Sample:** Full sample, no states excluded.

## Discrepancy Investigation: Balanced vs. Unbalanced Results

### Background

Section 5.2 contains balanced panel figures (earlier analysis) which showed [describe pattern]. Current V0 Figure 2s with both fixes applied show [describe pattern]. This section investigates the source of these discrepancies.

### Comparison Analysis

#### Sample Composition

**Balanced Sample (Section 5.2):**
- Counties included: [N]
- Balancing requirement: [description]
- Treatment timing distribution: [summary]

**Unbalanced Sample (Current V0 Fig 2):**
- Counties included: [N]
- No balancing restriction
- Treatment timing distribution: [summary]

#### Specification Comparison

![Comparison of balanced vs. unbalanced sample results](images/balanced_vs_unbalanced.png){#fig-comparison}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Sources of Discrepancy:**

1. **Sample Size Effect:** [How many more counties in unbalanced sample]

2. **Composition Effect:** [Which types of counties differ between samples]

3. **Treatment Timing:** [How treatment timing differs]

4. **Specification Differences:** [Any other spec differences beyond balancing]
:::

### Decomposition Analysis

To isolate the source of discrepancies, we ran:

1. **V0 Fig 2 specification on balanced sample**
   - Result: [outcome]
   - Interpretation: [what this tells us]

2. **Section 5.2 specification on full sample**
   - Result: [outcome]
   - Interpretation: [what this tells us]

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Conclusion:**

The discrepancy is primarily driven by [sample composition / balancing requirement / specification difference]. The fixes [do / do not] resolve the discrepancy. [Additional interpretation of what this means for our understanding of the results].
