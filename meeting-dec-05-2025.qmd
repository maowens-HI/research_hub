## Meeting Overview

**Date:** December 5, 2025

**Topic:** Presentation of Figure 2 Results with Both Fixes Applied

This document goes over the implementation of the figure 2 fixes identified on December 2nd. All analyses include both corrections: (1) setting `high=0` for never-treated units, and (2) removing interactions between "high" and year effects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Context: Fixes Applied

All results presented below incorporate the two fixes identified on December 2:

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Problem: Never-treateds** - Never-treated counties had missing values for `high` which led them to eb dropped from the regression despite the logic to include them.

**Fix 1: Missing Data Issue** - Set `high=0` for never-treated units to include them in interacted regressions

**Fix 2: Interaction Term Issue** - Removed interactions between "high" and year effects - Never-treated units now properly influence year effects for all groups

## Results: Six-Step Analysis Sequence

#### Figure 2.1: Baseline Spending Only (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-1}

**Specification:** Core event study with `baseline spending` quartiles only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Figure 2.2: Baseline + Income Quartiles (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-2}

**Specification:** Event study interacted with both `baseline spending` and `income` quartiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Figure 2.3: Baseline + Income + Reform Types (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-3}

**Specification:** Full model with `baseline spending`, `income quartiles`, and `reform type` indicators.

### Phase 2: Jackknife Robustness Checks

#### Figure 2.4: Baseline Spending Only (Jackknife) {#fig-2-4}

**Specification:** Jackknife with `baseline spending quartiles`, iteratively excluding each state.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Key Findings:** - \[Stability of results across state exclusions\] - \[Identification of influential states (if any)\] - \[Range of effect estimates across jackknife iterations\] - \[Comparison to non-jackknife baseline\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Figure 2.5: Baseline + Income Quartiles (Jackknife) {#fig-2-5}

**Specification:** Jackknife with baseline `spending` and `income` quartiles, iteratively excluding each state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Figure 2.6: Baseline + Income + Reform Types (Jackknife) {#fig-2-6}

**Specification:** Jackknife with all controls (`spending`, `income`, `reforms`), iteratively excluding each state.

## Cross-Specification Comparison

### Summary Table

| Figure | Controls                    | Jackknife |
|:-------|:----------------------------|:---------:|
| 2.1    | Baseline only               |    No     |
| 2.2    | Baseline + Income           |    No     |
| 2.3    | Baseline + Income + Reforms |    No     |
| 2.4    | Baseline only               |    Yes    |
| 2.5    | Baseline + Income           |    Yes    |
| 2.6    | Baseline + Income + Reforms |    Yes    |

### Key Takeaways

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**Patterns Observed:**

1.  **Effect Magnitude:** \[How effects compare across specifications\]

2.  **Heterogeneity:** \[Whether low-income areas show larger effects\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discrepancy Investigation: Balanced vs. Unbalanced Results

### Background

Section 5.2 contains balanced panel figures (earlier analysis) which showed \[describe pattern\]. Figure 2s examined on December 02 show \[describe pattern\]. This section investigates the source of these discrepancies.

### Comparison Analysis

#### Sample Composition

**Fig 1 Sample (Section 5.2):** - Counties included: \[N\] - Balancing requirement: \[description\] - Treatment timing distribution: \[summary\]

**Fig 2 Sample (Current V0 Fig 2):** - Counties included: \[N\] - No balancing restriction - Treatment timing distribution: \[summary\]

#### Specification Comparison

![Comparison of balanced vs. unbalanced sample results](images/balanced_vs_unbalanced.png){#fig-comparison}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Sources of Discrepancy:**

1.  **Sample Size Effect:** \[How many more counties in unbalanced sample\]

2.  **Composition Effect:** \[Which types of counties differ between samples\]

3.  **Treatment Timing:** \[How treatment timing differs\]

4.  **Specification Differences:** \[Any other spec differences beyond balancing\]
:::

### Decomposition Analysis

To isolate the source of discrepancies, we ran:

1.  **V0 Fig 2 specification on balanced sample**
    -   Result: \[outcome\]
    -   Interpretation: \[what this tells us\]
2.  **Section 5.2 specification on full sample**
    -   Result: \[outcome\]
    -   Interpretation: \[what this tells us\]

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Conclusion:**

The discrepancy is primarily driven by \[sample composition / balancing requirement / specification difference\]. The fixes \[do / do not\] resolve the discrepancy. \[Additional interpretation of what this means for our understanding of the results\].

## Implications & Next Steps

### Main Conclusions

1.  **Fix Effectiveness:** Both fixes successfully \[describe impact on results\]

2.  **Robustness:** The jackknife analysis shows \[degree of robustness/sensitivity\]

3.  **Heterogeneity:** \[Summary of income and reform type heterogeneity\]

4.  **Balanced vs. Unbalanced:** \[What we learned from the discrepancy investigation\]

### Recommendations

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**Moving Forward:**

1.  \[Recommendation based on results\]
2.  \[Additional analyses needed, if any\]
3.  \[Decisions about preferred specification\]
4.  \[Implications for paper narrative\]
