## Meeting Overview

**Date:** December 5, 2025

**Topic:** Presentation of Figure 2 Results with Both Fixes Applied

This document goes over the implementation of the figure 2 fixes identified on December 2nd. All analyses include both corrections: (1) setting `high=0` for never-treated units, and (2) removing interactions between "high" and year effects.

---

## Context: Fixes Applied

All results presented below incorporate the two fixes identified on December 2:

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Fix 1: Missing Data Issue**
- Set `high=0` for never-treated units to include them in interacted regressions

**Fix 2: Interaction Term Issue**
- Removed interactions between "high" and year effects
- Never-treated units now properly influence year effects for all groups

## Results: Six-Step Analysis Sequence

### Phase 1: No Jackknife Specifications

#### Figure 2.1: Baseline Spending Only (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-1}

**Specification:** Core event study with baseline spending quartiles only.

**Sample:** Full sample, no states excluded.

---

#### Figure 2.2: Baseline + Income Quartiles (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-2}

**Specification:** Event study interacted with both baseline spending and income quartiles.

**Sample:** Full sample, no states excluded.

---

#### Figure 2.3: Baseline + Income + Reform Types (No Jackknife) {#fig-2-3}

**Specification:** Full model with baseline spending, income quartiles, and reform type indicators.

**Sample:** Full sample, no states excluded.

### Phase 2: Jackknife Robustness Checks

#### Figure 2.4: Baseline Spending Only (Jackknife) {#fig-2-4}

**Specification:** Core event study with baseline spending quartiles, iteratively excluding each state.

**Method:** Jackknife resampling - each line represents results with one state removed.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Key Findings:**
- [Stability of results across state exclusions]
- [Identification of influential states (if any)]
- [Range of effect estimates across jackknife iterations]
- [Comparison to non-jackknife baseline]

#### Figure 2.5: Baseline + Income Quartiles (Jackknife) {#fig-2-5}

**Specification:** Event study with baseline spending and income quartiles, iteratively excluding each state.

**Method:** Jackknife resampling across full income heterogeneity specification.

#### Figure 2.6: Baseline + Income + Reform Types (Jackknife) {#fig-2-6}

**Specification:** Full model with all controls, iteratively excluding each state.

**Method:** Jackknife resampling across complete specification.

## Cross-Specification Comparison

### Summary Table

| Figure | Controls | Jackknife | 
|:-------|:---------|:---------:|
| 2.1 | Baseline only | No | 
| 2.2 | Baseline + Income | No | 
| 2.3 | Baseline + Income + Reforms | No | 
| 2.4 | Baseline only | Yes | 
| 2.5 | Baseline + Income | Yes | 
| 2.6 | Baseline + Income + Reforms | Yes | 

### Key Takeaways 

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**Patterns Observed:**

1. **Effect Magnitude:** [How effects compare across specifications]

2. **Heterogeneity:** [Whether low-income areas show larger effects]

## Discrepancy Investigation: Balanced vs. Unbalanced Results

### Background

Section 5.2 contains balanced panel figures (earlier analysis) which showed [describe pattern]. Figure 2s examined on December 02 show [describe pattern]. This section investigates the source of these discrepancies.

### Comparison Analysis

#### Sample Composition

**Fig 1 Sample (Section 5.2):**
- Counties included: [N]
- Balancing requirement: [description]
- Treatment timing distribution: [summary]

**Fig 2 Sample (Current V0 Fig 2):**
- Counties included: [N]
- No balancing restriction
- Treatment timing distribution: [summary]

#### Specification Comparison

![Comparison of balanced vs. unbalanced sample results](images/balanced_vs_unbalanced.png){#fig-comparison}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Sources of Discrepancy:**

1. **Sample Size Effect:** [How many more counties in unbalanced sample]

2. **Composition Effect:** [Which types of counties differ between samples]

3. **Treatment Timing:** [How treatment timing differs]

4. **Specification Differences:** [Any other spec differences beyond balancing]
:::

### Decomposition Analysis

To isolate the source of discrepancies, we ran:

1. **V0 Fig 2 specification on balanced sample**
   - Result: [outcome]
   - Interpretation: [what this tells us]

2. **Section 5.2 specification on full sample**
   - Result: [outcome]
   - Interpretation: [what this tells us]

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
**Conclusion:**

The discrepancy is primarily driven by [sample composition / balancing requirement / specification difference]. The fixes [do / do not] resolve the discrepancy. [Additional interpretation of what this means for our understanding of the results].

## Implications & Next Steps

### Main Conclusions

1. **Fix Effectiveness:** Both fixes successfully [describe impact on results]

2. **Robustness:** The jackknife analysis shows [degree of robustness/sensitivity]

3. **Heterogeneity:** [Summary of income and reform type heterogeneity]

4. **Balanced vs. Unbalanced:** [What we learned from the discrepancy investigation]

### Recommendations

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**Moving Forward:**

1. [Recommendation based on results]
2. [Additional analyses needed, if any]
3. [Decisions about preferred specification]
4. [Implications for paper narrative]
