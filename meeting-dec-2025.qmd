## Meeting Overview

**Date:** December 2, 2025

**Topic:** Figure 2 Fixes and Jackknife Analysis Strategy

This meeting addressed critical issues discovered in the Figure 2 analysis related to never-treated units and established a comprehensive plan for robustness checks.

---

## Figure 2 Fixes Identified

### 1. Missing Data Issue {#missing-data}

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Problem:** The "high" variable was undefined for never-treated units, causing them to be excluded from interacted regressions.

**Impact:** Never-treated units were being dropped from the analysis when they should have been included as controls.

**Solution:** Set `high=0` for never-treated units to ensure they are properly included in the regression analysis.
:::

**Technical Details:**

- Never-treated units are critical controls in difference-in-differences analysis
- The missing `high` variable created an unintended sample restriction
- By defining `high=0` for these units, we retain them in the analysis while maintaining the interpretation of the treatment effect

### 2. Interaction Term Issue {#interaction-term}

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Problem:** Year effects were incorrectly interacted with "high", preventing never-treated units from influencing year effects for high-treated counties.

**Impact:** The year fixed effects were being estimated separately for high and non-high groups, rather than being common across all units.

**Solution:** Remove interactions between "high" and year effects to allow never-treated units to dictate year effects across all groups.
:::

**Technical Details:**

- Year fixed effects should capture common time trends across all units
- Interacting year effects with treatment status fragmented the control for time trends
- Never-treated units provide crucial information about underlying time trends
- The fix ensures that year effects are estimated using all available data

## Next Steps for Myles

### Jackknife Analysis Sequence

The following sequence of analyses should be performed, applying both fixes identified above:

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
#### Analysis Workflow

**Phase 1: No Jackknife**

1. ✅ **Baseline spending only**
   - Core specification without additional controls
   - Establishes baseline treatment effect

2. **Baseline spending + income quartiles**
   - Tests whether effects vary by income level
   - Adds heterogeneity dimension

3. **Baseline spending + income quartiles + reform types**
   - Full specification with all heterogeneity controls
   - Most comprehensive model

**Phase 2: Jackknife Robustness**

4. **Baseline spending only, jackknife**
   - Iteratively remove each state
   - Tests sensitivity to influential states

5. **Baseline spending + income quartiles, jackknife**
   - Jackknife with income heterogeneity
   - Ensures results aren't driven by specific states

6. **Baseline spending + income quartiles + reform types, jackknife**
   - Full jackknife with all controls
   - Most rigorous robustness check
:::

### Priority Order

The analyses should be completed in the exact order listed above:

| Step | Specification | Jackknife | Priority |
|:----:|:-------------|:---------:|:--------:|
| 1 | Baseline only | No | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Baseline + Income | No | **Next** |
| 3 | Baseline + Income + Reforms | No | High |
| 4 | Baseline only | Yes | High |
| 5 | Baseline + Income | Yes | Medium |
| 6 | Baseline + Income + Reforms | Yes | Medium |

## Additional Investigation Required

### Discrepancy Analysis {#discrepancy}

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
**Task:** Investigate discrepancies between balanced figures in section 5.2 and current regression results.

**Context:**
- Section 5.2 contains balanced panel figures (earlier analysis)
- Current V0 Figure 2s now have both fixes applied
- Need to understand why results differ between these two approaches

**Questions to Address:**
- What is driving the difference in results?
- Is it the balancing requirement, the sample composition, or the specification?
- Do the fixes resolve the discrepancies or are there additional issues?
:::

### Investigation Steps

1. **Compare Samples**
   - Document which counties are included in balanced vs. unbalanced samples
   - Calculate sample sizes and treatment timing distributions

2. **Compare Specifications**
   - Verify that both use the same regression specification (aside from balancing)
   - Check if controls and fixed effects match

3. **Decompose Differences**
   - Run the V0 Figure 2 specification on the balanced sample
   - Run the section 5.2 specification on the full sample
   - Identify which component drives the discrepancy

4. **Document Findings**
   - Create a summary table comparing results across specifications
   - Provide interpretation of what the differences mean for our conclusions

## Key Takeaways

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### Summary of Actions

1. **Immediate:** Both fixes (missing data and interaction term) must be applied to all Figure 2 analyses going forward

2. **Short-term:** Complete the six-step analysis sequence outlined above

3. **Medium-term:** Resolve the discrepancy between balanced and unbalanced results

4. **Documentation:** Track results systematically to identify patterns across specifications
