# About the Research Hub {.page-title}

Understanding the long-term effects of education finance policy through rigorous, transparent research.
:::

## Current Research Focus

Our primary research project examines the long-term impacts of school finance reforms on educational and economic outcomes. This work involves:

- **Panel Data Construction:** Building comprehensive county-level datasets of per-pupil expenditures spanning multiple decades
- **Causal Identification:** Employing event study designs and robustness checks to isolate causal effects
- **Methodological Innovation:** Developing and refining techniques for handling complex panel data challenges
- **Replication & Transparency:** Ensuring our findings are reproducible and our methods are clearly documented

## Methodology

Our research employs state-of-the-art econometric techniques including:

- **Event Study Designs:** Tracking outcomes before and after policy changes
- **Jackknife Standard Errors:** Accounting for clustering and serial correlation
- **Heterogeneity Analysis:** Examining how effects vary across different contexts
- **Extensive Robustness Checks:** Testing sensitivity to sample definitions, weighting schemes, and model specifications

## Data & Transparency

We are committed to open science practices:

- All code is documented and version-controlled
- Data sources and processing steps are clearly described
- Intermediate results and notes are shared publicly
- We maintain detailed research logs tracking methodological decisions

## Collaboration

This research is conducted in collaboration with academic economists and policy researchers. We welcome inquiries about our work and opportunities for collaboration.
