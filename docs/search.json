    "text": "Research Timeline\nA chronological record of project milestones and findings.\n\n\nDecember 2025\n\nDec 05: December Meeting - Analysis Review\nTopic: Latest Figure 1 & 2 plus some notes on fixes.\nView Full Meeting Notes\n\n\n\nDec 05: JK Instability - Jackknife Classification Issues\nTopic: Investigation of jackknife classification instability in Approach II.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Finding: Two states (Ohio and Texas) have below-average spending growth for their high-baseline-spending counties. When these states are left out in the jackknife step, their influence disappears, and counties that underperform in the full sample suddenly receive inflated predicted spending values. This pushes them incorrectly into the “high predicted” category\nImpact: 840 observations (11.9% of the “high” group) contaminate the jackknife results, compressing the event-study trends.\n\n\n\n\nView JK Instability Analysis\n\n\n\n\nDec 02: Figure 2 Fixes & Jackknife Strategy\nTopic: Resolving the “Never Treated” interaction issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBug Found: “High” variable was defined as missing for never-treated units, dropping them from interaction regressions.\nFix: Define high=0 among NTs and remove interaction with year effects (let NTs dictate year effects).\n\n\n\nNext Steps (Jackknife Iterations):\n\nBaseline spending only (No Jackknife)\nBaseline + Income Quartiles (No Jackknife)\nBaseline + Income + Reform Types (No Jackknife)\nRepeat 1-3 with Jackknife.\n\n\nView Jackknife Code Review\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 2025\n\nNov 25: Robustness & JJP Comparison\nTopic: Jackknife vs Non-Jackknife and Sample Selection Bias.\n\nDecision: Run Fig 1 among bottom 10% baseline spending counties.\nContext (JJP Comparison): JJP’s Figure 1 (large effect) uses PSID-linked districts (~10% of districts, selected for low income). JJP Appendix B2 (all districts) shows smaller effects closer to our findings.\n\nView Analysis\n\n\n\nNov 17-21: District & Panel Analysis\nTopic: District level expansion and balancing checks.\n\nBalance Exercise: Sample balanced on non-missing lexp_ma_strict from event times -5 to 17.\nHypothesis: Aggregating to county level smooths variation across districts, potentially leading to smaller effects than JJP.\n\n\nDistrict Level Results Balanced Panel Results\n\n\n\n\nNov 06: Sample Variations (Fig 1 & 2)\nTopic: Robustness checks across weighted/unweighted and sample restrictions.\n\nSummary TableAll Counties SampleRestricted Sample\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure\nSample Definition\nWeighted\nLink\n\n\n\n\nFig 1\nIncludes counties w/ &gt;2 non-tract areas\nYes\nView\n\n\nFig 1\nIncludes counties w/ &gt;2 non-tract areas\nNo\nView\n\n\nFig 1\nExcludes counties w/ &gt;2 non-tract areas\nYes\nView\n\n\nFig 1\nExcludes counties w/ &gt;2 non-tract areas\nNo\nView\n\n\n\n\n\nIncludes all counties regardless of non-tract area count.\n\nFigure 1s (Weighted): View Results\nFigure 1s (Unweighted): View Results\nFigure 2s (Weighted): View Results\n\n\n\nExcludes problematic counties (≥2 non-tract areas).\n\nFigure 1s (Weighted): View Results\nFigure 1s (Unweighted): View Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2025\n\nOct 31: The “Mixed” County Problem\nTopic: Handling counties with multiple non-tracted areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Issue: We lack school-age population data for non-tracted areas. If a county has &gt;1 non-tracted area, we cannot weight them relative to each other.\nThe Fix: Combine all non-tracted areas in a county into a single “pseudo-area.” Average their PPE (unweighted), then weight this pseudo-area against the tracts using the residual county population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 28: Defining “Good” Counties\nTopic: Creating a clean baseline dataset.\n\nDefinition: A “Good County” is one where every linked tract/LEAID has non-missing spending data for every year from 1966-1971.\nAction: Created indicator variables good_county_6671 to filter samples.\n\n\n\n\nOct 24: Baseline Year Selection\n\nFindings: 1971 vs. 1966-70 average yields similar results.\nDecision: Use 1971 on its own or average across several years (robustness check).\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\nOct 21: Pre-Quartile Splits\n\nGoal: Compare individual pre-quartile splits (e.g., 1967 vs 1971) to ensure single-year spikes aren’t driving results.\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\nOct 17: Interpolation & Winsorizing\n\nMethod: Winsorize all spending values at 1st and 99th percentiles (within year).\nRefinement: Interpolate at the district level before tract-to-county processing (previously done at tract level).\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\nOct 11: Common Core & Balancing\n\nData Update: Incorporated Common Core spending data through 2018-19.\nBalancing: Redefined lead_5 to bin all earlier years; lag_17 bins all later years. Exclude counties treated 2000+.\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\nOct 07: Debugging pred_spend\n\nChallenge: Event studies by pred_spend went in opposite directions than expected.\nAction: Step-by-step reconstruction (Simple event study → Baseline Quartile split → pred_spend construction).\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 2025\n\nSep 30: Reform Variables\n\nDecision: Build pred_spend without reforms to isolate variable issues.\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\nSep 23: Wisconsin Binning Fix\n\nBug: Coefficients for lead 16-19 were empty, but lead 20 was non-empty.\nCause: Binning issue in estimation. Fixed.\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\nSep 02: Hanushek vs. JJP\n\nAction: Re-run First Stage Approach 1 using only JJP reform info (ignore Hanushek table for now) to ensure replication.\n\nView Full Notes\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2025\n\nAug 26: Data Cleaning\n\nImputation: Imputed 1986 enrollment using 1987 numbers for district 3416800.\nZero Values: For 1983 enrollment==0, replaced with ’84 (or ’82) values.\n\n\n\n\nAug 19: JJP Methodology Deep Dive\nTopic: Weighting and Rolling Windows.\n\nDifference: JJP uses district-level; we use county-level.\nVariable Definitions:\n\nCurrent year spending (weighted by 1972 pop).\nLog average PPE over 13-year rolling window (missing if &lt;13 years data).\nLog average PPE over available data (filling missing years with 1967 value).\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 01: The PPE Formula\nTopic: Calculating Per Pupil Expenditures (PPE) for split tracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogic for Primary/Secondary Tracts:\n\nGet Primary PPE and Secondary PPE.\nGet share of students in tract who are Primary-age vs Secondary-age.\nFormula: (PrimaryPPE * PrimaryShare) + (SecondaryPPE * SecondaryShare)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2025\n\nJuly 29: Duplicate Tracts\n\nIssue: Tracts appearing multiple times (once for elementary, once for secondary).\nResolution: Reshape to tract level with separate variables for elementary/secondary districts.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 15: Geographic Challenges\n\nIssue: Difficulty mapping districts to counties via tracts.\nStrategy: If population weighting fails, default to centroids. Match failures (un-tracted areas) assigned to counties via GRF.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 11: Project Kickoff\n\nGoal: Produce panel of per-pupil spending at the county level.\nRationale: We only observe birth location at the county level."

    "text": "Partial replication and extension of Jackson, Johnson, and Persico (2016)\n\n\nView on GitHub\n\n\n\nThis repository supports a partial replication and extension of “The Effects of School Spending on Educational and Economic Outcomes: Evidence from School Finance Reforms” by C. Kirabo Jackson, Rucker C. Johnson, and Claudia Persico (2016, QJE). The original study examines how increases in school spending, driven by exogenous timing of court-ordered School Finance Reforms (SFRs), affect long-run educational attainment and adult labor market outcomes, particularly among children from low-income families.\nOur work reconstructs the district-level finance panel (F-33 and INDFIN) used in the paper and extends it to county geographies to enable compatibility with proprietary Census data. This involves reprocessing the 1969 GRF (Geographic Reference File) to link school districts with Census tracts and counties, addressing non-tract areas, and implementing aggregation logic for counties with both tract and non-tract zones.\n\n\n\nThe original JJP (2016) paper and its Online Appendix describe the following key data and methods:\nData Sources:\n\nINDFIN Historical Database (FY 1967,1969–1991) — standardized local government finances including school districts\nCommon Core of Data (CCD) NCES F-33 Finance Survey (post-1992 annual continuation)\n1969–70 School District Geographic Reference File (GRF) for linking Census tracts to pre-reform district geographies\n\nIdentification Strategy:\n\nCourt-ordered School Finance Reforms (SFRs) serve as exogenous shocks\nThe number of years of exposure to initial SFR is the treatment variable\nEvent-study and 2SLS models estimate causal impacts on spending and individual outcomes\nData on court rulings comes from a preceding NBER working paper: https://www.nber.org/papers/w20118\n\nOur Specific Aims:\n\nDevelop crosswalks linking F-33 (District) ↔︎ INDFIN (District) ↔︎ Tract (GRF) ↔︎ County (GRF) identifiers\nReconstruct consistent annual per-pupil spending at the county level\nUse this data to estimate event studies akin to figure 1 JJP 2016\nExtend the analysis with jackknife regressions to identify which counties experienced the largest spending increases from school finance reforms akin to figure 2 in JJP 2016\n\n\n\n\nschool_finance/\n├── README.md                          # Project

tract definitions\nSample Restrictions: Counties with complete baseline data (1967, 1970-1972) for quality analysis\n\nKey Variables:\n\nSpending: pp_exp (nominal), pp_exp_real (2000 dollars), lexp_ma_strict (log spending with 13-year rolling mean)\nPopulation: school_age_pop (used for weighting in aggregation)\nTreatment: reform_year (year of court-ordered SFR), relative_year (years since

packages via: ssc install [package_name]\n\n\n\n\nThe pipeline follows a sequential process:\nPhase I: Data Construction\n\n01_build_district_panel.do - Builds district-year panels from F-33 and INDFIN, creates canonical LEAID ↔︎ GOVID crosswalks\n02_build_tract_panel.do - Parses 1969 GRF to link districts to Census tracts, assigns single LEAID per tract\n03_adjust_inflation.do - Adjusts tract-level spending for inflation using FRED CPI-U data\n04_tag_county_quality.do - Tags counties as “good” or “bad” based on baseline year data completeness (1967, 1970-1972)\n05_create_county_panel.do - Interpolates district panel, re-assigns to tracts, imports enrollment data, collapses to county-year panel\n\nPhase II: Main Analysis\n\n06_A_county_balanced_figure1.do - County-level event-study analysis (Figure 1 replication)\n\nCreates balanced panel with complete event windows (-5 to +17 years)\nRuns weighted

    "text": "Design Vision Document A comprehensive guide to the visual identity, layout structure, and user experience for a modern policy-research institute website.\n\n\n\nThis brief establishes the design direction for a research hub website that communicates credibility, expertise, and modern professionalism. The aesthetic balances academic seriousness with contemporary elegance—approachable enough for media and policymakers, rigorous enough for economists and researchers.\nCore Design Principles: - Clarity over complexity - Authority without stuffiness - Timeless elegance, not fleeting trends - Content as the hero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\nColor\nHex\nUsage\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nWarm Off-White\n#FAFAF8\nPage backgrounds, cards\n\n\nSurface\nSoft Pearl\n#F5F5F3\nSecondary surfaces, alternating sections\n\n\nPrimary Text\nDeep Charcoal\n#2D3436\nBody copy, headings\n\n\nSecondary Text\nSlate Grey\n#636E72\nCaptions, metadata, dates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\nColor\nHex\nUsage\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Accent\nOxford Blue\n#1E3A5F\nCTA buttons, links, key highlights\n\n\nAccent Hover\nDeep Navy\n#152A45\nButton hover states\n\n\nAccent Light\nMist Blue\n#E8EEF4\nSubtle backgrounds, tags, badges\n\n\nSuccess/Highlight\nTeal Accent\n#0A7B7B\nOptional secondary accent for variety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe palette draws from institutional design—think established universities, respected journals, serious think tanks. The Oxford Blue accent conveys trust and intellectual depth without the coldness of pure navy. The warm off-white base prevents the clinical sterility common in academic sites while maintaining professionalism.\nUsage Rules: - Accent color appears sparingly: buttons, links, active states, key highlights - Never more than 15% of any given page should be accent-colored - Text always maintains high contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/* Primary: Headings & Display */\nfont-family: 'Inter', 'SF Pro Display', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;\n\n/* Body Text */\nfont-family: 'Inter', 'SF Pro Text', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;\n\n/* Monospace (code, data) */\nfont-family: 'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\nSize\nWeight\nLine Height\nLetter Spacing\n\n\n\n\nHero Headline\n48–56px\n700 (Bold)\n1.1\n-0.02em\n\n\nHero Tagline\n20–24px\n400 (Regular)\n1.5\n0\n\n\nSection Headers (H2)\n32–36px\n600 (Semi-bold)\n1.2\n-0.01em\n\n\nCard Titles (H3)\n20–24px\n600 (Semi-bold)\n1.3\n0\n\n\nBody Text\n16–18px\n400 (Regular)\n1.7\n0.01em\n\n\nSmall/Meta Text\n14px\n400 (Regular)\n1.5\n0.02em\n\n\nButton Text\n15–16px\n600 (Semi-bold)\n1\n0.03em\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerous line height (1.6–1.7) for body text ensures academic content remains digestible\nTight tracking on headlines creates visual impact\nNo decorative fonts—readability is paramount\nHeadlines use sentence case, not ALL CAPS (more approachable, less aggressive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  [Navigation Bar]                                                    │\n│  Logo (left)              Home | About | People | Research | Blog   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                      │\n│                                                                      │\n│         ADVANCING SOUND ECONOMIC POLICY                             │\n│              FOR THE 21ST CENTURY                                   │\n│                                                                      │\n│      Rigorous research.

The Oxford Blue accent conveys trust and intellectual depth without the coldness of pure navy. The warm off-white base prevents the clinical sterility common in academic sites while maintaining professionalism.\nUsage Rules: - Accent color appears sparingly: buttons, links, active states, key highlights - Never more than 15% of any given page should be accent-colored - Text always maintains high contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This document explains the fixes implemented for the Jackknife Figure 2 issues identified on December 2nd. The core problem was that although all counties received a predicted spending value, only ever-treated counties were assigned a value for the binary indicator high.

    "text": "This memo explains why the jackknife plots sometimes show the “high” group dipping below the “low” group. After applying the fixes Nick flagged on Tuesday, the updated charts look cleaner, but the same core issue remains: the jackknife estimates often compress the “high” group and, in several cases, push it below the “low” group.\nThe main mechanism is straightforward. Some counties that are classified as low in the full-sample prediction model (because predicted spending &lt; 0) flip into the high category when their own state is excluded from the model during the jackknife procedure. This misclassification is likely not the only problem in the jackknife approach, but it appears to be a major contributor to the pattern we observe.\nA closer investigation shows that two states — Ohio and Texas — have below-average spending growth among counties that should be in the highest-baseline-spending group. When these states are left out in the jackknife step, their influence disappears, and counties that underperform in the full sample suddenly receive inflated predicted spending values. This pushes them incorrectly into the “high predicted” category.\n\n\n\nThe goal is simple:\n\nAssign each county a predicted spending change.\n\nCreate a binary indicator equal to 1 if predicted spending &gt; 0 and 0 otherwise (for ever-treated counties).\n\nRun an event-study regression using that binary variable.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this should yield the intuitive ordering: high above low.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep things simple, consider the specification that controls only for baseline 1971 spending quartile. In the baseline approach, we use the full sample and regress expenditure on quartile indicators. This produces predicted spending values, which we then use to define high (predicted &gt; 0). Running an event-study with this high variable delivers the expected pattern: high consistently exceeds low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Event study estimates by baseline spending quartile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe jackknife repeats the same regression multiple times, each iteration excluding one state. For each iteration, we:\n\nRe-estimate the model without state s.\n\nGenerate predicted spending for counties in the omitted state.\n\nAssign those counties to high/low based on the jackknife prediction.\n\nMove on to the next state.\n\nThe advantage is that no single state can dominate the prediction model. The problem is that when we use these jackknife-based predictions to create the high variable for the second-stage event study, we sometimes obtain the reverse ordering: the low group sits above the high group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Event study estimates by baseline spending and income quartiles\n\n\n\nOrdinarily I would assume this pattern reflects a coding mistake, because mechanically the high group should exceed the low group. But after checking the underlying data more closely, that explanation doesn’t hold.\nTabulating pre_q × high (baseline spending quartile × high/low classification) shows the issue clearly:\n\n\n\nQuartile\nRegular High\nJackknife High\nDifference\n\n\n\n\npre_q 1\n3,080\n3,080\n0\n\n\npre_q 2\n3,136\n3,136\n0\n\n\npre_q 3\n0\n504\n+504\n\n\npre_q 4\n0\n336\n+336\n\n\nTotal\n6,216\n7,056\n+840\n\n\n\nFinding: 840 counties from pre_q 3 and pre_q 4 (the highest-baseline-spending groups) switch from “low” to “high” under the jackknife. These are units that should theoretically have lower predicted spending changes, not higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the flips, we compare the coefficients that form predicted spending in the full sample versus the jackknife runs for Ohio and Texas. Predicted spending equals the main effect plus the quartile adjustment relative to quartile 1 (main + ppe). Here, ppe3 and ppe4 refer to the coefficients on lag_*#pre_q3 and lag_*#pre_q4.\n\n\nFull Sample - main = 0.0208505\n- ppe3 = −0.0227245\n- ppe4 = −0.0299217\nOhio Omitted - main = 0.0138311\n- ppe3 = −0.0193518\n- ppe4 = −0.0120878\nTexas Omitted - main = 0.0248799\n- ppe3 = −0.0052331\n- ppe4 = −0.0299885\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ohio is excluded, ppe4 rises from −0.0299217 to −0.0120878 (+0.0178339).\nThis boosts quartile-4 predicted spending enough to flip 336 quartile-4 counties into the high group.\nWhen Texas is excluded, ppe3 rises from −0.0227245 to −0.0052331 (~+0.0174914).\nThis raises quartile-3 predicted spending, flipping 504 quartile-3 counties into the high group.\n\nTogether, these shifts generate 840 additional “high predicted” classifications that only appear under the jackknife. This inflates the size of the high group with counties that actually exhibit weak spending growth, which pulls down the average effect for the high group and produces the inversion seen in the jackknife plots."

    "text": "The jackknife classification instability is driven by two influential states (Ohio and Texas) whose pre_q 3/4 counties have below-average spending growth. The leave-one-state-out methodology causes these counties to be classified as “high predicted” based on other states’ patterns, contaminating the high group with counties that actually underperformed.\nThis represents a limitation of the Approach II methodology when applied to samples with influential outlier states, rather than a coding error. The finding suggests caution in interpreting the jackknife heterogeneity results and motivates robustness checks excluding or separately examining Ohio and Texas."

    "text": "To understand the flips, we compare the coefficients that form predicted spending in the full sample versus the jackknife runs for Ohio and Texas. Predicted spending equals the main effect plus the quartile adjustment relative to quartile 1 (main + ppe). Here, ppe3 and ppe4 refer to the coefficients on lag_*#pre_q3 and lag_*#pre_q4.\n\n\nFull Sample - main = 0.0208505\n- ppe3 = −0.0227245\n- ppe4 = −0.0299217\nOhio Omitted - main = 0.0138311\n- ppe3 = −0.0193518\n- ppe4 = −0.0120878\nTexas Omitted - main = 0.0248799\n- ppe3 = −0.0052331\n- ppe4 = −0.0299885\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ohio is excluded, ppe4 rises from −0.0299217 to −0.0120878 (+0.0178339).\nThis boosts quartile-4 predicted spending enough to flip 336 quartile-4 counties into the high group.\nWhen Texas is excluded, ppe3 rises from −0.0227245 to −0.0052331 (~+0.0174914).\nThis raises quartile-3 predicted spending, flipping 504 quartile-3 counties into the high group.\n\nTogether, these shifts generate 840 additional “high predicted” classifications that only appear under the jackknife. This inflates the size of the high group with counties that actually exhibit weak spending growth, which pulls down the average effect for the high group and produces the inversion seen in the jackknife plots."

In the baseline approach, we use the full sample and regress expenditure on quartile indicators. This produces predicted spending values, which we then use to define high (predicted &gt; 0).
