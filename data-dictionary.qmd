## Geographic Identifiers

Understanding the ID systems is critical for working with this codebase. Multiple identifier systems are used across different data sources.

### Primary Identifiers

| Identifier | Format | Length | Description | Example |
|------------|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **LEAID** | SSDDDDD | 7 chars | NCES Local Education Agency ID | 0100005 |
| **GOVID** | SS5CCCDDD | 9 chars | Government ID (State+Type+County+District) | 015000100 |
| **tract70** | SSCCCBTCTSC | 11 chars | 1970 Census tract code | 01001000100 |
| **county** | SSCCC | 5 chars | State FIPS + County FIPS | 01001 |

### Identifier Components

| Component | Position | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **SS** | 1-2 | State FIPS code |
| **CCC** | 3-5 | County FIPS code |
| **DDDDD** | 3-7 (LEAID) | District code within state |
| **BTCTSC** | 6-11 (tract70) | Basic Tract + Tract Suffix Code |

## Spending Variables

### Raw Spending Measures

| Variable | Type | Units | Description |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| `pp_exp` | Continuous | Nominal $ | Per-pupil expenditure (current dollars) |
| `pp_exp_real` | Continuous | 2000 $ | Inflation-adjusted per-pupil expenditure |
| `total_exp` | Continuous | $ | Total expenditure for district/county |

### Transformed Spending Measures

| Variable | Type | Units | Description |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| `lexp` | Continuous | Log | Natural log of real per-pupil expenditure |
| `lexp_ma` | Continuous | Log | Log of 13-year rolling mean (lenient) |
| `lexp_ma_strict` | Continuous | Log | Log of 13-year rolling mean (strict: requires all 13 years) |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### Rolling Mean Construction

The 13-year rolling mean (`lexp_ma_strict`) requires non-missing spending data for all 13 years in the window. This creates a more restrictive but cleaner sample for analysis.

- **Lenient version** (`lexp_ma`): Uses available years, filling gaps with 1967 baseline
- **Strict version** (`lexp_ma_strict`): Missing if <13 years of data available

## Population Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `school_age_pop` | Integer | School-age population (ages 5-17) |
| `enrollment` | Integer | Actual school enrollment |
| `pop_weight` | Continuous | Population weight for aggregation |

## Treatment Variables

### Reform Indicators

| Variable | Type | Values | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| `reform_year` | Integer | 1971-2000 | Year of court-ordered school finance reform |
| `ever_treated` | Binary | 0/1 | State had SFR during sample period |
| `never_treated` | Binary | 0/1 | State had no SFR during sample |
| `post` | Binary | 0/1 | Observation is post-reform |

### Event Study Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `relative_year` | Integer | Years since reform (-∞ to +∞) |
| `lead_*` | Binary | Indicator for years before reform |
| `lag_*` | Binary | Indicator for years after reform |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### Event Time Convention

- **lead_5**: 5+ years before reform (binned)
- **lead_4** to **lead_1**: 4 to 1 years before reform
- **lag_0**: Year of reform (omitted reference)
- **lag_1** to **lag_16**: 1 to 16 years after reform
- **lag_17**: 17+ years after reform (binned)

## Sample Restrictions

### Standard Restrictions

```stata
