## 2 December 2025

In this document we investigate our code which builds predicted-spending for our figure 2s.

## 25 November 2025

In this document I present jackknife and non jackknife regressions.

## 6 November 2025

### All Counties

[Figure 1s Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_4_25_wt/)

This set of figures are weighted and include all counties regardless of how many non-tract areas they contain.

[Figure 1s not Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_4_25_no_wt/)

This set of figures are not weighted and include all counties regardless of how many non-tract areas they contain.

[Figure 2s Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_6_25_wt/)

This contains results from jackknife regressions using baseline spending and fmaily income.

### No Problematic Counties

[Figure 1s Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_3_25_wt/)

This set of figures are weighted and do not include counties where there are \>= 2 non-tract areas present.

[Figure 1s not Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_3_25_no_wt/)

This set of figures are not weighted and do not include counties where there are \>= 2 non-tract areas present.

Findings: 1. We ruled out using only one of the earlier years. 2. Our choice is 71 on its own or average across several years.

Goals: 1. Figure 2's with restricted set of counties. 2. Indicator variable for missing vs non missing baseline spending.

Goals for next meeting:

1.  Compare individual pre-q splits: Check whether quartiles based on different single years (e.g., 1967 vs 1971) yield meaningfully different results. If they're similar, the specific year doesn't matter; if not, investigate why or consider instability across years.

2.  Compare single-year vs average pre-q splits: See if defining quartiles from a multi-year average changes the overall patterns. If differences are small, either approach is fine; if large, the average version is likely more robust and should be preferred.

-   **Challenges**
    -   We discussed our confusion with the variable `pred_spend`.
    -   We examined several figure 2 event studies using a different combination of reforms.
    -   We are unsure how never_treateds should be incorporated or if they should be given a `pred_spend`.
-   **Decisions**
-   We decided to build `pred_spend` without reforms to see if something fundamental is wrong with `pred_spend` or if it is`reform_*`.

-   **Challenges**
-   We primarily reviewed 9/16/25 notes which featured regression output for Wisconin's jacknife regression.\
-   The central problem was that there was a binning issue when these results were estimated which is now fixed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 16 September 2025

-   **Methods / Models**
    -   We investigate suspicious zero coefficients in the equation IV estiamte for Wisconsin\
    -   We walkthrough the footnote 20 predicted spend code to ensure coefficients are added correctly\
-   **Challenges**
    -   We discuss the incorrection addition of predicted spending.
    -   We need to add the main effects.
    -   Binning needs to be: lag_20 = rel_year \>= 20 & \~missing(rel_year)

## 9 September 2025

-   **Decisions Made**
    -   We chose the "strict" moving average model.\
-   **Methods / Models**
    -   Compared pros and cons of two moving average models.\
    -   Example included to illustrate crux of discussion.\
    -   Outlined estimation of JJP equation 4 for one state.\
-   **Challenges**
    -   Difficulties calculating predicted spending change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5 September 2025

-   **Decisions Made**
    -   Standardized coding to JJP's Table D.\
-   **Methods / Models**
    -   Documented mismatches between Hanushek's dataset and JJP Table D.\
    -   Sketched estimation steps for Figure 2, including dropping state data and setting up interactions.\
    -   Estimated Figure 1 including never-treated observations.

-   **Methods / Models**
    -   Estimated Figure 1 using JJP Table D over Hanushek database.\
-   **Findings**
    -   Results consistent with prior Figure 1 estimates.
