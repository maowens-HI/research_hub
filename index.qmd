##### All Counties

**Weighted Figures**

[Figure 1s Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_4_25_wt/) - Weighted and include all counties regardless of how many non-tract areas they contain.

[Figure 1s not Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_4_25_no_wt/) - Not weighted and include all counties regardless of how many non-tract areas they contain.

[Figure 2s Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_6_25_wt/) - Results from jackknife regressions using baseline spending and family income.

##### No Problematic Counties

**Restricted Sample**

[Figure 1s Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_3_25_wt/) - Weighted and do not include counties where there are >= 2 non-tract areas present.

[Figure 1s not Weighted](https://maowens.quarto.pub/11_3_25_no_wt/) - Not weighted and do not include counties where there are >= 2 non-tract areas present.

## Summary

**Findings:**

1. We ruled out using only one of the earlier years.
2. Our choice is 71 on its own or average across several years.

**Goals:**

1. Figure 2's with restricted set of counties.
2. Indicator variable for missing vs non missing baseline spending.

## Goals for Next Meeting

1. **Compare individual pre-q splits:** Check whether quartiles based on different single years (e.g., 1967 vs 1971) yield meaningfully different results. If they're similar, the specific year doesn't matter; if not, investigate why or consider instability across years.

2. **Compare single-year vs average pre-q splits:** See if defining quartiles from a multi-year average changes the overall patterns. If differences are small, either approach is fine; if large, the average version is likely more robust and should be preferred.

## Challenges & Decisions

**Challenges:**

- We discussed our confusion with the variable `pred_spend`.
- We examined several figure 2 event studies using a different combination of reforms.
- We are unsure how never_treateds should be incorporated or if they should be given a `pred_spend`.

**Decisions:**

- We decided to build `pred_spend` without reforms to see if something fundamental is wrong with `pred_spend` or if it is `reform_*`.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## Challenges

- We primarily reviewed 9/16/25 notes which featured regression output for Wisconsin's jackknife regression.
- The central problem was that there was a binning issue when these results were estimated which is now fixed.

## Methods / Models

- We investigate suspicious zero coefficients in the equation IV estimate for Wisconsin
- We walkthrough the footnote 20 predicted spend code to ensure coefficients are added correctly

**Challenges:**

- We discuss the incorrect addition of predicted spending.
- We need to add the main effects.
- Binning needs to be: `lag_20 = rel_year >= 20 & ~missing(rel_year)`

## Summary

**Decisions Made:**

- We chose the "strict" moving average model.

**Methods / Models:**

- Compared pros and cons of two moving average models.
- Example included to illustrate crux of discussion.
- Outlined estimation of JJP equation 4 for one state.

**Challenges:**

- Difficulties calculating predicted spending change.

## Summary

**Decisions Made:**

- Standardized coding to JJP's Table D.

**Methods / Models:**
