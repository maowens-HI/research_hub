# December 2025

### Dec 02: Figure 2 Fixes & Jackknife Strategy
**Topic:** Resolving the "Never Treated" interaction issue.

> [**View Jackknife Code Review**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/jk_code_review/)

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Bug Found:** "High" variable was defined as missing for never-treated units, dropping them from interaction regressions.
**Fix:** Define `high=0` among NTs and remove interaction with year effects (let NTs dictate year effects).
:::

**Next Steps (Jackknife Iterations):**
1.  Baseline spending only (No Jackknife)
2.  Baseline + Income Quartiles (No Jackknife)
3.  Baseline + Income + Reform Types (No Jackknife)
4.  *Repeat 1-3 with Jackknife.*

# November 2025

### Nov 25: Robustness & JJP Comparison
**Topic:** Jackknife vs Non-Jackknife and Sample Selection Bias.

> [**View Analysis**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/jackknife/)

* **Decision:** Run Fig 1 among bottom 10% baseline spending counties.
* **Context (JJP Comparison):** JJP's Figure 1 (large effect) uses PSID-linked districts (~10% of districts, selected for low income). JJP Appendix B2 (all districts) shows smaller effects closer to our findings.

### Nov 17-21: District & Panel Analysis
**Topic:** District level expansion and balancing checks.

* [District Level Results](https://maowens.quarto.pub/district_and_top_100/)
* [Balanced Panel Results](https://maowens.quarto.pub/balanced-panel-event-study-analysis/)

**Key Actions:**
* **Balance Exercise:** Sample balanced on non-missing `lexp_ma_strict` from event times -5 to 17.
* **Hypothesis:** Aggregating to county level smooths variation across districts, potentially leading to smaller effects than JJP.

### Nov 06: Sample Variations (Fig 1 & 2)
**Topic:** Robustness checks across weighted/unweighted and sample restrictions.

# October 2025

### Oct 31: The "Mixed" County Problem
**Topic:** Handling counties with multiple non-tracted areas.



::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**The Issue:** We lack school-age population data for non-tracted areas. If a county has >1 non-tracted area, we cannot weight them relative to each other.
**The Fix:** Combine all non-tracted areas in a county into a single "pseudo-area." Average their PPE (unweighted), then weight this pseudo-area against the tracts using the residual county population.
:::

### Oct 28: Defining "Good" Counties
**Topic:** Creating a clean baseline dataset.

* **Definition:** A "Good County" is one where every linked tract/LEAID has non-missing spending data for **every year from 1966-1971**.
* **Action:** Created indicator variables `good_county_6671` to filter samples.

### Oct 24: Baseline Year Selection
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/10_24_25-b397/)

* **Findings:** 1971 vs. 1966-70 average yields similar results.
* **Decision:** Use 1971 on its own or average across several years (robustness check).

### Oct 21: Pre-Quartile Splits
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/10_21_25-da7b/)

* **Goal:** Compare individual pre-quartile splits (e.g., 1967 vs 1971) to ensure single-year spikes aren't driving results.

### Oct 17: Interpolation & Winsorizing
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/10_17_25/)

* **Method:** Winsorize all spending values at 1st and 99th percentiles (within year).
* **Refinement:** Interpolate at the *district* level before tract-to-county processing (previously done at tract level).

### Oct 11: Common Core & Balancing
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/10_10_25/)

* **Data Update:** Incorporated Common Core spending data through 2018-19.
* **Balancing:** Redefined `lead_5` to bin all earlier years; `lag_17` bins all later years. Exclude counties treated 2000+.

### Oct 07: Debugging `pred_spend`
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/10_7_25/)

* **Challenge:** Event studies by `pred_spend` went in opposite directions than expected.
* **Action:** Step-by-step reconstruction (Simple event study $\to$ Baseline Quartile split $\to$ `pred_spend` construction).

# September 2025

### Sep 30: Reform Variables
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/9_30_25/)

* **Decision:** Build `pred_spend` *without* reforms to isolate variable issues.

### Sep 23: Wisconsin Binning Fix
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/9_23_25/)

* **Bug:** Coefficients for lead 16-19 were empty, but lead 20 was non-empty.
* **Cause:** Binning issue in estimation. Fixed.

### Sep 02: Hanushek vs. JJP
[**View Full Notes**](https://maowens.quarto.pub/jjp_first_stage/)

* **Action:** Re-run First Stage Approach 1 using *only* JJP reform info (ignore Hanushek table for now) to ensure replication.

# August 2025

### Aug 26: Data Cleaning
* **Imputation:** Imputed 1986 enrollment using 1987 numbers for district 3416800.
* **Zero Values:** For 1983 `enrollment==0`, replaced with '84 (or '82) values.

### Aug 19: JJP Methodology Deep Dive
**Topic:** Weighting and Rolling Windows.

* **Difference:** JJP uses district-level; we use county-level.
* **Variable Definitions:**
    1.  Current year spending (weighted by 1972 pop).
    2.  Log average PPE over 13-year rolling window (missing if <13 years data).
    3.  Log average PPE over available data (filling missing years with 1967 value).

### Aug 01: The PPE Formula
**Topic:** Calculating Per Pupil Expenditures (PPE) for split tracts.



::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Logic for Primary/Secondary Tracts:**
1.  Get Primary PPE and Secondary PPE.
2.  Get share of students in tract who are Primary-age vs Secondary-age.
3.  **Formula:** `(PrimaryPPE * PrimaryShare) + (SecondaryPPE * SecondaryShare)`

# July 2025

### July 29: Duplicate Tracts
**Issue:** Tracts appearing multiple times (once for elementary, once for secondary).
**Resolution:** Reshape to tract level with separate variables for elementary/secondary districts.

### July 15: Geographic Challenges
**Issue:** Difficulty mapping districts to counties via tracts.
**Strategy:** If population weighting fails, default to centroids. Match failures (un-tracted areas) assigned to counties via GRF.

### July 11: Project Kickoff
**Goal:** Produce panel of per-pupil spending at the county level.
**Rationale:** We only observe birth location at the county level.
