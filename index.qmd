## Welcome to Research Hub

This is a Quarto-based research platform designed for organizing, documenting, and sharing research projects, data analysis, and scientific findings.

## Key Features

- **Reproducible Research**: Integrate code, analysis, and documentation in one place
- **Multi-Language Support**: Work with R, Python, Julia, and other languages
- **Dynamic Content**: Create interactive reports with live code execution
- **Version Control**: All work is tracked with Git for collaboration and reproducibility
- **Publishing Ready**: Generate publication-quality documents, presentations, and websites

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Create New Content**: Add `.qmd` files to create new research documents or analyses
2. **Run Analysis**: Embed code chunks directly in your documents for reproducible research
3. **Preview Changes**: Use `quarto preview` to see your changes in real-time
4. **Publish**: Render your work with `quarto render` to share with others

### Example: Running Code

You can embed and execute code directly in your documents. Here's a simple example:

```{r}
# Load basic statistics
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
summary_stats <- summary(data)
print(summary_stats)
```

## Project Organization

This research hub follows a structured approach:

- **Home**: Overview and quick access to key resources (this page)
- **About**: Information about the project and contributors
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides and references (see `claude.md`)

## Common Research Tasks

### Data Analysis Workflow

1. Import your data
2. Clean and preprocess
3. Perform statistical analysis
4. Visualize results
5. Document findings
6. Share reproducible reports

### Adding New Research Pages

To add a new research page:

1. Create a new `.qmd` file (e.g., `my-analysis.qmd`)
2. Add it to the navigation in `_quarto.yml`
3. Write your content using Markdown and code chunks
4. Render to see results
